An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for interacting with the Gerrit code
review system. This server allows a language model like Gemini to query changes,
retrieve details, and manage reviews by executing `curl` commands against the
Gerrit REST API.

This server can be run as a persistent **HTTP server** or on-demand via **STDIO**.

## Modifications from upstream

*   **Threaded comment replies**: `post_review_comment` supports `in_reply_to` for replying to existing comment threads.
*   **Comment IDs in output**: `list_change_comments` now includes the comment `id`, enabling targeted replies.
*   **Change message log**: New `list_change_messages` tool to retrieve the full change log (patchset uploads, CI results, review scores, etc.).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed and available in
your system's `PATH`.

*   **Python 3.11+**: The build script requires a modern version of Python.
*   **curl**: The standard command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.

### 2. Build the Environment

Run the build script from the root of the `gerrit-mcp-server` project directory.
This will create a Python virtual environment, install all dependencies, and
make the server ready to run.

```bash
./build-gerrit.sh
```

### 3. Configure the Server

You will need to create a `gerrit_config.json` file inside the
`gerrit_mcp_server` directory. Copy the provided sample file
`gerrit_mcp_server/gerrit_config.sample.json` and customize it for your
environment. See the **[Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)** for
details on all available options.

```bash
cp gerrit_mcp_server/gerrit_config.sample.json gerrit_mcp_server/gerrit_config.json
```

### 4. Run the Server (HTTP Mode)

To run the server as a persistent background process, use the `server.sh` script:

*   **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    ./server.sh start
    ```
*   **Check the status:**
    ```bash
    ./server.sh status
    ```
*   **Stop the server:**
    ```bash
    ./server.sh stop
    ```

For on-demand STDIO mode, please see the **[Gemini CLI Setup Guide](docs/gemini-cli.md)**.
